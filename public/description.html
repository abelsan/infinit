	As part of the Strategic Sustainable Desalination Network (SSDN) project ongoing at the Center for Complex Engineering Systems (CCES) at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), this open web platform aims to support decision-makers to make well-informed near-term and long-term decisions for the efficient water supplies, taking Saudi Arabia as a case study.

	While single facility analysis is very informative, the water/energy network model views a single plant as part of a larger network representing a region or the entire nation.
	Since desalination plants and power plants are increasingly connected together with water pipelines and electricity transmission lines, evaluating a standalone plant as a node in a larger network is compelling.

	The water/energy network analysis should be able to investigate and identify candidate locations for sustainable desalination plant investments, accounting for the existing assets and the current investment plans.
	The geographical aspect of individual resource production and distribution can be quantitatively handled by a graph-theoretic approach.

	Since multiple interacting resources or "commodities" share the same network such as water (potable, non-potable, and waste water) and electricity, this problem can be modeled as a multi-commodity network flow problem.
	In light of the limitations of the classical network flow models, this study employs a new network flow model called the INFINIT (interdependent network flows with induced internal transformation) model.
	This modeling methodology, with some mathematical modifications to the classical models, can handle a network flow of multiple commodities that interact with each other in many ways including flow transformation (commodity conversion).
	Using the INFINIT model enables to address water-energy nexus issues and to optimize the flow of multiple resources as well as placement of new water/energy facilities at the individual facility level.

	The INFINIT model in this study formulates and solves mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems to minimize the designated multi-objective functions such as the total cost (CAPEX and OPEX) and the total CO2 emission.
	After optimization, the Pareto-optimal solutions with different network flow topology and the downselected potential locations for new facilities are obtained.
	In addition to the network model, due to the high degree of complexity of the problems being addressed, it is also important that the decision support system is able to effectively visualize alternative design and policy scenarios.
